## PyCitySchools 
This repository contains data analysis performed using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks for Challenge 4 of Data Analytics Bootcamp at University of Toronto.

The analysis is based on the data provided in two CSV files for schools and students for the district. 

A merged dataset is created as a first step to analyze the provided datasets for school and students in conjunction with each other. A high-level summary is then created for this dataset presenting highlights for the district. The parameters in this summary include size (number of students), total budget, average math and reading scores, and % of students passing math, reading, and both math and reading by getting a score of 70 or higher). Mostly the same parameters are calculated for the subsequent analyses.

Next, another dataset is created to analyze the metrics on per school level. An additional column is created to display calculation for per student budget for every school in the dataset.

The next two sections display the 5 top performing and 5 bottom performing schools based on overall passing scores.

Average Math and Reading scores for students in grades 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th are then retrieved separately to identify any differences or trends based on the student grades.

Another dataset is created to illustrate the average scores and passing rates for students based on average spending per student in the schools. Four spending ranges are created for this dataset for analyzing the impact of spending on student performance. 

One more dataset is then created to illustrate the average scores and passing rates for students based on school size. Three school sizes are created for this dataset for analyzing the relationship between number of students in a school and student performance. 

Lastly, another dataset is created to analyze the average scores and passing rates for different school types, i.e. Charter and District.

# Analysis
The Jupyter Notebbok file contains step-by-step analysis for each dataset created.
A written report is created separately in both MS Word and PDF formats to present a summary and analyze any trends and conclusions from the data.
